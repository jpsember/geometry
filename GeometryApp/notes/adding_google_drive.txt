Adding Google Drive Android API (GDAA) to a project
-----------------------------------------------------

See this link:

https://developers.google.com/drive/android/get-started#get_an_android_certificate_and_register_your_application

To change the package name from js.xxx to com.js.xxx, we needed a new Client ID.

[] Go to https://console.developers.google.com/project
[] Select the RBuddy project
[] Select APIS & AUTH
[] Select Credentials
[] Select 'Create new Client ID'.
[] Select 'Installed application'; 'Android'
[] For package name, use 'com.js.rbuddy'; e.g. EXACTLY what appears quoted in the
   RBuddyApp AndroidManifest.xml file, as the package attribute (package="com.js.rbuddy")
[] From Terminal, in the RBuddyApp directory, type
     keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -list -v
   For password, use: android
[] Copy the SHA1 text to the appropriate field in the Google developers console
[] Leave Deep Linking disabled
[] Select 'Create Client ID'
[] Download the JSON for the certificate and store in a safe place; I'm not sure if it's ok to
   include this in the public GitHub repository; it's the debug version of the certificate, not the development
   one, but for safety I'm omitting it.
