# geometry

This is an Android application framework for developing 2D algorithms, using
OpenGL.  It has an 'algorithm stepper' feature, which lets you step through an
algorithm,  to aid in testing and debugging.

The video shows an example app that implements three algorithms: a dynamic
Delaunay triangulation, a star-shaped polygon triangulation, and a general
(simple) polygon triangulation.

Here's a video of the algorithm stepper in action:
